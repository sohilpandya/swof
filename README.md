# [swof App](https://swof.herokuapp.com/)

#### https://swof.herokuapp.com/

This Support Wheel of Fate App generates rota for engineers.

Someone has to do it! :blush:
What is a fair way to tackle this? (_some rules_)
- [x] An engineer can only do one half-day shift on a given day
- [x] An engineer cannot work two days in a row
- [x] An engineer should have completed one whole day of support in any 2 week period

#### How it works
This app allows you to generate a shift per day. For testing purposes, we also have a fake shift generator button at the bottom, which will allow you to cycle through the shifts so that you can check all the criteria for selecting engineers has been met.
