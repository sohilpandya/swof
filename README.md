Support Wheel of Fate to generate rota for engineers.

## What

Shift Generator for Engineers to help with support work

## Why

Someone has to do it! :blush:
Fairest way to do?
- An engineer can only do one half-day shift on a given day
- An engineer cannot work two days in a row
- An engineer should have completed one whole day of support in any 2 week period

## How

**Build an App!** :wink:
